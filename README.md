# Zlow: Browser-Based Cycling Simulator Prototype

A modular, browser-based cycling simulator. Built with JavaScript, A-Frame, and Bluetooth APIs, with Strava export integration.

## Features
- **Bluetooth Connectivity:** Connect to Wahoo-compatible smart trainers, poll real-time power, cadence, and speed.
- **3D Environment:** Rendered with A-Frame, includes terrain, scenery, and a simple avatar.
- **Pacer Rider:** Fixed-power pacer for comparison.
- **HUD Overlay:** Shows power, cadence, speed, distance, time, and position vs. pacer.
- **Strava Export:** Upload ride data to Strava via API after each session.
